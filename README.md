## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vehicle length and ground clearance, as well as the intercept, provide a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because there are several variables, and the residual standard of error is ~8.8 on 44 degrees of freedom.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The linear model predicts the mpg MechaCar prototypes effectively because it gives insight to how significant vehicle length and ground clearance is to mpg.
